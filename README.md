# Project4

This project explores experimental data of glucose tolerance tests in subjects. Subjects were charecterised as male/female, wildtype/mutant.
First, we try to see if there is any clustering of subjects using unsupervised machine learning.
Then we explore four machine learning classifcation algorithms, to assess the efficacy of each.
Then after choosing the most successful algorithm (random forest), we explore this deeper, and try to optimise as best we can.
